# Face Recognition System Using Machine Learning with GUI

Welcome to the **Face Recognition System** project! This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust face recognition system using machine learning, complemented by a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). 

### Key Features:
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier, a well-known face detection model, to accurately identify and detect faces in real-time.
- **Face Recognition:** Implements the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm, a powerful machine learning technique, to recognize and distinguish between different faces.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Python's Tkinter library, the GUI offers an intuitive and interactive platform for users to easily operate the face recognition system.

### Project Overview:
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning algorithms like LBPH can be applied to face recognition tasks. By combining the strengths of the Haar Cascade model for face detection and the LBPH algorithm for face recognition, this system can effectively detect and identify individuals in various scenarios.

The GUI created using Tkinter enhances user interaction, allowing users to upload images, capture live video feeds, and manage face data conveniently.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and applying the Haar Cascade face detection model.
- **LBPH Algorithm:** For implementing the face recognition functionality.
- **Tkinter:** For building the graphical user interface.
